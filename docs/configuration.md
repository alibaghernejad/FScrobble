# ðŸ›  Configuration
FScrobble requires linking to at least one scrobbling server to function properly.  
Running the application without configuring a server will result in no activity or functionality.  

**Important:** FScrobble does not automatically scrobble musics for all MPRIS-compatible media players on your system. This is a deliberate design choice to protect your privacy. It is strongly recommended to explicitly allow only the media players you trust. 
Additionally, FScrobble provides the flexibility to define metadata rules for each allowed media player, enabling fine-grained control over what gets scrobbled. 

## Supported Scrobbling Servers:

- [x] ![Last.fm](assets/lastfm-icon-48x48.png) **Last.fm** (Supported)
- [ ] ![Libre.fm](assets/librefm-icon-48x48.png) **Libre.fm** (Not Implemented yet)
- [ ] ![ListenBrainz](assets/listenbrainz-icon-48x48.png) **ListenBrainz** (Not Implemented yet)
- [ ] ![Maloja](assets/maloja-icon-32x32.png) **Maloja** (Not Implemented yet)

## Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. Obtain your **API Key** and **Secret** from [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). Ensure you have a Last.fm account to access these credentials.
To configure your Last.fm API keys, use environment variables:
2. Update the `settings.json` file or set the following environment variables with your credentials:

   **Using Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export LastFm__ApiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
   export LastFm__ApiSecret=YOUR_API_SECRET
   ```

   **Using `settings.json`:**
   Create or update a `settings.json` file in the application's configuration directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "LastFm": {
       "ApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
       "ApiSecret": "YOUR_API_SECRET"
     }
   }
   ```
 3. Initialize the connection to **Last.fm** by running the following command and following the on-screen instructions:
      ```bash
      cd FScrobble/FScrobble.Shell
      dotnet run connect lastfm
      ```
4. If the setup is successful, you will see something like this message:
   _"Connection to .. scrobbling server successfully initialized."_
5. After completing the setup, close the program and start it in normal mode:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
6. Verify that scrobbling is working by visiting your scrobbling dashboard and checking if your recently played tracks are being recorded.

By default, FScrobble allows scrobbling for a limited set of MPRIS-compatible media players to ensure user privacy and security. 

## Default Allowed Media Players:
   - [**Musikcube**](https://musikcube.com): A lightweight CLI-based media player.
   - [**YouTube Music**](https://music.youtube.com): A popular music streaming service.
